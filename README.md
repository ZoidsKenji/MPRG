## Describtion

This is my A-Level cs NEA project, a Motorway Pursuit Racing Game.
The C# codes are inside the MPRG folder.
The game is a motorway racing game where there is an infinitely long motorway with traffic. You and your opponent will race through traffic and if the last place is too far away from the first place, then they will constantly lose health. And there will be police chasing as well, which will try to stop you by crashing into you and your opponent. When you crash into traffic or collide with anything such as police car or opponent you will also lose health, and the last one survive wins. The opponent will be control either by an AI or online player as it must face different situations and as the further you go the traffic became denser. For the last place you will be randomly given a skills like health regenerationâ€¦
